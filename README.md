# Teeth_Classification
Our goal is to develop a comprehensive teeth classification solution that includes  preprocessing and visualizing dental images, as well as a robust computer vision model  capable of accurately classifying teeth into seven distinct categories.
By building a CNN model without using pre-trained models and another one using pre-trained models to improve accuracy, we can utilize it in Healthcare.
