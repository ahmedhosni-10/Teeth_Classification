# ðŸ¦· Teeth Classification (Custom CNN from Scratch)

This project presents a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for dental health analysis. The primary goal was to create a tailored solution from the ground up, avoiding pre-trained models, to classify dental images into **7 distinct categories**.

### Model Performance
The model demonstrates solid performance and good generalization, achieving the following scores:
* **Training Accuracy:** 86%
* **Validation Accuracy:** 90%
* **Testing Accuracy:** 91%

### Repository Contents
This repository contains the complete `Jupyter Notebook` that documents the end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It also includes key visualizations: the model architecture (`model_arch.png`), training/validation curves (`curve.png`), and the final confusion matrix (`cm.png`). To get started, simply clone the repository and explore the notebook.
